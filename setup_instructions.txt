# Credit Card Fraud Detection System Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+ installed on your system
2. Pip package manager

## Installation Steps

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install required packages**
   ```
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn xgboost
   ```

4. **Set up directory structure**
   Make sure all files are in the same directory:
   - app.py
   - model.py
   - utils.py
   - visualization.py
   - .streamlit/config.toml (Create .streamlit folder and place config.toml inside)

5. **Run the application**
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your web browser.

## Using Your Own Dataset
To use your own dataset with the application, it should:
1. Be in CSV format
2. Include features (columns) that represent transaction attributes
3. Have a 'Class' column with 0 for legitimate transactions and 1 for fraudulent transactions

## Additional Notes
- The system will automatically handle:
  - Missing values
  - Feature scaling
  - Class imbalance (if you select this option)
  - Outlier treatment (if you select this option)

- For large datasets, processing may take some time, especially during model training with hyperparameter tuning.

- If you encounter memory issues, consider:
  - Using a subset of the data
  - Disabling hyperparameter tuning
  - Selecting fewer models to train

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter "Module not found" errors, ensure all required packages are installed
- For visualization issues, make sure matplotlib and seaborn are properly installed
- If experiencing performance issues, try reducing the dataset size or selecting fewer features
